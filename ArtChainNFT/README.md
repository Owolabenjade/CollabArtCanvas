**Collaborative Generative Art Canvas**

### Use Case: **Community-Driven Generative Mural for Social Causes**

**Overview**:  
Imagine a global digital mural created for a social cause or event, such as environmental conservation or cultural celebration. This mural evolves with each contribution from participants worldwide, transforming into a unique generative artwork over time. Participants are encouraged to contribute to this communal piece by selecting their desired parameters, such as specific colors, shapes, or even styles that reflect their interpretation of the theme. 

**Process**:  
1. **Contribution**: Each participant can contribute by choosing parameters for their layer. For example, a contributor might select green hues and organic shapes to symbolize trees, or they may use geometric patterns in earthy colors for a cultural tribute.
2. **Canvas Evolution Tracking**: Every new input dynamically changes the mural's look, layering contributions while keeping the artwork's theme cohesive. Contributors can view the canvas’s history and how it evolved over time, showing each layer’s addition and the mural’s transformation.
3. **Minting & NFT Snapshots**: Each contributor has the option to mint an NFT snapshot of the canvas as it appeared during their contribution. This NFT can serve as a personal keepsake or proof of their contribution to the communal art piece. 
4. **Revenue Sharing & Sales**: The completed artwork could be auctioned or sold as a collective NFT, with a portion of the proceeds shared among contributors. Alternatively, all proceeds could go to a designated charity, creating a social impact that reflects the cause of the mural.

**Benefits**:
- **Community Engagement**: People worldwide can participate in a creative, social initiative.
- **Unique Ownership**: Each NFT snapshot holds personal and unique significance, as it captures the mural at a specific, individualized point in its evolution.
- **Transparency & Fairness**: The Clarity smart contract ensures transparent distribution of funds, rewarding contributors fairly.
- **Social Impact**: Using art as a medium, participants collectively contribute to a cause, strengthening community bonds while supporting charitable goals.

This use case showcases the potential for blockchain technology to foster collective creativity and social impact, using generative art as the connecting medium.
